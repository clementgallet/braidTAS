Introduction
============

This repository holds all files and informations on my current tool-assisted speedrun of Braid. It consists mainly of the .wtf file containing all inputs, and some general comments.

Configuration
=============

Hourglass
---------

Version r81

Configuration:
- Sound > Disable DirectSound Creation > checked
- Runtime > Performance > Store Video Memory in Savestates > unchecked
- Runtime > Performance > Store Guarded Memory Pages in Savestates > unchecked
- Arrow keys for controling Tim are buggy with hourglass. Mapping arrow keys to zqsd.

Braid
-----

Version 1.015

Command line arguments: `-60fps -windowed -width 800 -height 600`

Computer
--------

Hourglass does not always behave the same depending on the computer, so here is my main specs:
- Dell Precision T3500
- Intel Xeon W3530 4 x 2.80Ghz
- 3 Go RAM
- NVIDIA Quadro FX 580
- Windows 7 Professionnel 32-bits SP1


RAM adresses
============

- 00586764 and 00586774 (floats): x position of Tim when on the ground
- 0058B270 and 0058B278 (floats): x position of the camera
- 0058B274 and 0058B27C (floats): y position of the camera

Current progress
================

- Main hub and World 2 hub: 1211 frames. [Outdated video in 1218 frames](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57820665/braid_start.mkv).

Physics
=======

Speed is expressed in [internal units]/frame

Acceleration is expressed in [internal units]/frame²

- capped speed on flat surface: 4
- going up or down is slower (i.e. stairs on the hub: 3.464)
- landing on a downward slope gives a small boost (i.e. stairs on the hub: ~4.5-4.8)
- acceleration on the ground: 0.2
- acceleration on the air: 0.213333...
- change direction on the ground: 0.485
- change direction on the air: 0.213333...
